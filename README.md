# Docker for Machine Learning

Why Dockers for ML? \
Docker has become an indispensable tool for machine learning, offering a powerful solution to many of the challenges faced by data scientists and ML engineers. This containerisation technology provides a standardised, portable, reproducible environment for developing, testing, and deploying ML models. 
By encapsulating all necessary dependencies, libraries, and configurations, Docker ensures consistency across different systems and eliminates the infamous "it works on my machine" problem ðŸ˜‰.
